# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 Log

### Day 6: August 3rd 2018

**Today's Progress:** Lots of notes made on HTML from Jon Duckett's book

**Thoughts:** Rather than lessons, I wanted to start getting caught up on note-taking. Even though today was technically a day off, due to having to do some work, going to meet a friend at lunch etc, I didn't end up starting tonight until 8:30. Despite that though, I've still made nearly 7 big pages of notes and once I'm done with this section on forms, I'll nearly be done with the HTML part of the book and then I can start making all my CSS notes. And then maybe I can have a go at creating some CSS images myself.

### Day 5: August 2nd 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Applied Visual Design unit.

**Thoughts:** I've loved finishing off the unit tonight - I covered off how to animate using CSS, using different animation properties, keyframes and bezier curves. I don't fully understand the bezier curve stuff, so I'll dig into that more, but it's been really fun to create shapes and animations tonight. Once I've written up my notes for these two units (which I hope to do tomorrow as I have the day off), I'm going to try my hand at some pure CSS images.

In terms of my notes, I have a lovely [Code & Quill Monolith](https://www.codeandquill.com/products/monolith) that I've been using so far, but obviously it's not ideal for writing out huge chunks of CSS or HTML. I think I might have to play with making some notes digitally and then referring to them within my handwritten notes. I probably need to spend some time planning out exactly what to do.

We also did a chunk about colour theory tonight, and I also learned about using hsl (hue, saturation, light) notation rather thn RBG or hex code. Lots to write up and get thinking about. The next unit is "Applied Accessibility", which focuses on how to keep content as accessible as possible. The next few units don't have a huge amount of lessons in, so with any luck in a few days I'll be onto the projects I need to complete to earn my Responsive Web Design Certification :) Buuut I also want to create some CSS images!

While I've been using only Github and Github Pages to host stuff I've done in the past, I think there might be some value in setting up an account on Codepen too. Will think about that over the weekend.

### Day 4: August 1st 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got about half-way through the Applied Visual Design section.

**Thoughts:** It's interesting how this unit seems to be purely CSS and I can see how a lot of what I would learn from this will help with building CSS images. Covering off things like transparency, positioning and layers will all be really important. I am going to have to make a butt-load of notes though. I flicked through my Jon Duckett HTML & CSS book last night and I couldn't see a huge amount that would apply to pure CSS images, but it might be a case of not really knowing what I'm looking at yet.

It is exciting though - I'm looking forward to taking on some daily image challenges and seeing what I can come up with. I think there's some stuff coming up in the course (which I'll hopefully get to tomorrow) that will help when it comes to animations too.

But I've managed 4 days on the trot now, which is the best I've done in a long time! That also feels nice... like I might actually make some progress and move on with things.

### Day 3: July 31st 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the CSS unit - began to learn more about creating pure CSS images.

**Thoughts:** Interesting stuff tonight - the lessons I took at the end of this unit about creating and using custom CSS variables were all done via the use of pure CSS images, such as this one:

I've seen similar things pop up online before, where people have been creating pure CSS images as part of their learning experience and *now I get what they mean and how they do it!* Well, not totally how, since I need to learn a lot more about CSS, but you get the idea. Will spend some time digging into this as I go through the front-end unit.

Didn't get round to making any notes - unless I'm sat at a proper desk, I find that a little hard to do. If it comes to it, I have a day off on Friday so I can catch up then. It's quite interesting and inspiring to see what people are creating just with the aid of CSS. There were a ton of examples in [this article](https://code.likeagirl.io/100-days-of-code-challenge-completed-bbce87f04c00) from someone who completed 100 Days of Code and wrote about it on Medium.

### Day 2: July 30th 2018

**Today's Progress:** Most of the FCC CSS unit.

**Thoughts:** As with the HTML unit, I've done most of this before, although with the new curriculum a few new lessons have been added. Also can tell that I'm going to need to make a few more notes around classes and how to use CSS styling in-line vs in a style tag - the syntax is slightly different each time, so just have to make sure I'm 100%.

Sad I couldn't get through the whole unit tonight, but I have to be up early in the morning for the gym, and my brain isn't up to doing any more tonight I don't think. I'll get this unit done tomorrow, write up my notes and maybe make a few more notes from my Jon Duckett HTMl/CSS book, which I've been doing on-and-off as well. Consistency is what's important right now!

### Day 1: July 29th 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Frontend Certification and completed the Basic HTML & HTML5 unit. 

**Thoughts:** I've done most of this unit before - they added a couple of new lessons as part of the new curriculum, so I'm mostly going over old ground today.

I hadn't remembered that using a "#" in a `href` tag turns it into a dead link. That's good to know.

`image` and `input` elements are self-closing. Got a few bits to add to my notes tomorrow, although some may already be in there.

Tomorrow, back to CSS!

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
