# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 Log

### Day 2: July 31st 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the CSS unit - began to learn more about creating pure CSS images.

**Thoughts:** Interesting stuff tonight - the lessons I took at the end of this unit about creating and using custom CSS variables were all done via the use of pure CSS images, such as this one:

I've seen similar things pop up online before, where people have been creating pure CSS images as part of their learning experience and *now I get what they mean and how they do it!* Well, not totally how, since I need to learn a lot more about CSS, but you get the idea. Will spend some time digging into this as I go through the front-end unit.

Didn't get round to making any notes - unless I'm sat at a proper desk, I find that a little hard to do. If it comes to it, I have a day off on Friday so I can catch up then. It's quite interesting and inspiring to see what people are creating just with the aid of CSS. There were a ton of examples in [this article](https://code.likeagirl.io/100-days-of-code-challenge-completed-bbce87f04c00) from someone who completed 100 Days of Code and wrote about it on Medium.

### Day 1: July 30th 2018

**Today's Progress:** Most of the FCC CSS unit.

**Thoughts:** As with the HTML unit, I've done most of this before, although with the new curriculum a few new lessons have been added. Also can tell that I'm going to need to make a few more notes around classes and how to use CSS styling in-line vs in a style tag - the syntax is slightly different each time, so just have to make sure I'm 100%.

Sad I couldn't get through the whole unit tonight, but I have to be up early in the morning for the gym, and my brain isn't up to doing any more tonight I don't think. I'll get this unit done tomorrow, write up my notes and maybe make a few more notes from my Jon Duckett HTMl/CSS book, which I've been doing on-and-off as well. Consistency is what's important right now!

### Day 0: July 29th 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Frontend Certification and completed the Basic HTML & HTML5 unit. 

**Thoughts:** I've done most of this unit before - they added a couple of new lessons as part of the new curriculum, so I'm mostly going over old ground today.

I hadn't remembered that using a "#" in a `href` tag turns it into a dead link. That's good to know.

`image` and `input` elements are self-closing. Got a few bits to add to my notes tomorrow, although some may already be in there.

Tomorrow, back to CSS!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
